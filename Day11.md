ðŸš€ **SQL Basics with H2 Database: Today's Lesson Recap!** ðŸš€

Today, we dove into the fundamentals of SQL using H2db, our lightweight, in-memory database that's perfect for learning and practice. We covered a lot of ground, and now it's time for students to put their knowledge to the test with an assignment.

**ðŸ—‚ Key Topics Covered:**
1. **Setting Up H2db:** We started by setting up our own "mini filing cabinet" for data.
2. **Creating Tables:** Learned how to create tables to organize our data.
3. **CRUD Operations:** Practiced adding, viewing, updating, and deleting data.
4. **Joins and Relationships:** Explored how to connect related data across tables using SQL JOINs.
5. **Aggregate Functions:** Summarized and analyzed data with functions like COUNT and AVG.

**ðŸŽ¯ Assignment:** 
Now it's your turn! Apply what you've learned by completing the exercises I provided, including creating new tables, connecting data with JOINs, and using aggregate functions.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Consistent practice is key to mastering SQL. The more you experiment with queries and data, the more confident you'll become.
